"""
A script to generate a harness shell script for running eval in a cluster.

Given a model directory, this script looks for a `harness.conf` file. The file describes the path to the pretrained model (or the HuggingFace model name), the model arguments, the tasks to run, and other details.

Example usage:

    python scripts/generate_harness.py models/stablelm/stablelm-jp-3b-ja50_rp50-700b/

Given these details the script outputs a command line which will run eval.

In detail, a config has two kinds of sections: the `[model]` section contains general model options, while task-specific sections have names like `[tasks.MY_TASK-0.1]`.

The model section contains the following values:

- model: almost always hf-causal
- path: the first arg to AutoModel.load_model
- tokenizer: path to the tokenizer
- args: any other model arguments

You can use interpolation in the config file, so it's commmon to include a `project_dir` value and use it like this:

    tokenizer = ${project_dir}/tokenizers/hogehoge

Task sections just contain the `fewshot` parameter for now.

Configs support inheritance. The file at `models/harness.conf` specifies global defaults, while files for each model group can define options not specific for a model. These files are usually the most detailed, since task and prompt selection are usually consistent for a model group.
